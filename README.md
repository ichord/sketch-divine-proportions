# Sketch Divine Proportions

![Banner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ichord/sketch-divine-proportions/banner/banner.png)

Basically, it's a clone edition of https://github.com/marcosecchi/divine_proportions_toolkit  
But not completely cloned yet. I'm working on it.

## Installing Plugins

1. [Download the ZIP file](https://github.com/ichord/sketch-divine-proportions/archive/master.zip)
2. Copy the contents to the plugin folder (Open up Sketch, and go to `Plugins` › `Reveal Plugins Folder…` to open it.)

## How-to

Just select the proportion you want.  
And then you can rotate it and change it's color, border and so on.
