Basically, it's a clone edition of https://github.com/marcosecchi/divine_proportions_toolkit  
But not completely cloned yet. I'm working on it.

## Installing Plugins

1. [Download the ZIP file](https://github.com/ichord/sketch-divine-proportions/archive/master.zip)
2. Copy the contents to the plugin folder (Open up Sketch, and go to `Plugins` › `Reveal Plugins Folder…` to open it.)

## How-to

First, select a layer, some layers or no layers.  
Then select the proportion option; They would be drawn within the selection.  
After drawing the shape, you can rotate it and change it's color, border and so on.
